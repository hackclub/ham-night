            Calling all tech enthusiasts, makers, and radioheads! Get ready ready to dive into the world of ham radio!
            You'll learn all about radio communication, connect with a cool community, and earn your technician
            licenseâ€”the first step in your ham radio journey.
            <br>
            <br>
            We run a program that meets every night from
            <span class="font-semibold">8-9 PM Eastern Time</span> to
            study together. Don't worry if you can't make it to
            every sessionâ€”you can always study alone at your own pace. As
            long as you've passed the test by May 31st, you'll
            qualify for our grant, which covers the cost of your
            technician license. No alarms, and no surprises!
          </p>
